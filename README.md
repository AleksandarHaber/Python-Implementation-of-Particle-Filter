Particle Filter Implementation in Python

Note this:
    
This Python source file implements a simple particle filter. It implements the
bootstrap particle filter which is also known 
as the sequential importance resampling particle (SIR) filter.  
Note that the code is not optimized, and everything is implemented such 
someone who only has basic knowledge of Python can perfectly understand 
the code. Of course, we can write a more fancier and more professional 
implementation by using an object oriented approach, however, 
such an implementation will not be easily understandable by complete beginners.
Also, we do not want to blur the main ideas of the algorithm with advanced 
implementation. 

In our future tutorials, we will explain how to implement particle filters in 
a more efficient and disciplined manner
